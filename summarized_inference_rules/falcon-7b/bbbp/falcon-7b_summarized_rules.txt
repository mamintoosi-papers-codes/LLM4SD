## Summary of Inference Rules:

These rules establish a strong correlation between atomic composition and the probability of a molecule being BBBP (likely a specific chemical compound). The core finding is that **a molecule is highly likely to be BBBP if it contains a greater number of either Bisphenol (B) *or* Carbon (C) atoms compared to Oxygen (O) atoms.**

**Refined List of Rules:**

1. **If the number of Bisphenol (B) atoms > number of Oxygen (O) atoms, then P(BBBP) > 0.9.**
2. **If the number of Carbon (C) atoms > number of Oxygen (O) atoms, then P(BBBP) > 0.9.**

**Rationale for Consolidation:**

Rules 1 & 2 were originally presented as separate conditions based on different elements. However, both demonstrate the *same principle*: a surplus of either B or C relative to O strongly suggests the molecule is BBBP.  The original rules were redundant and have been streamlined for clarity and conciseness.
